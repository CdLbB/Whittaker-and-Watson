\chapter{The Expansion of Functions in Infinite Series}

\Section{7}{1}{A formula due to Darhoux*TODO.  Journal de Math. (3), ii. (1876), p. 271.}

Let $f(z)$ be analytic at all points of the straight line joining $a$
to $z$, and let $\phi(t)$ be any polynomial of degree $n$ in $t$.

Then if $0 \leq t \leq 1$, we have by differentiation
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\dd }{\dd t}
  \sum_{m=1}^{n} (-)^{m} (z-a)^{m} \phi^{(n-m)}(t) f^{(m)}(a + t(z-a))
  \\
  =
  -(z-a) \phi^{(n)}(t) f'(a + t(z-a))
  +
  (-)^{n} (z-a)^{n+1} \phi(t) f^{(n+1)}(a + t (z-a)).
\end{align*}

Noting that $\phi^{(n)}(t)$ is constant $= \phi^{(n)}(0)$, and integrating
between the limits $0$ and $1$ of $t$, we get
\begin{align*}
  \phi^{(n)}(0) \thebrace{ f(z) - f(a) }
  \\
  =&
  \sum_{m=1}^{n} (-)^{m-1} (z-a)^{m}
  \thebrace{
    \phi^{(n-m)}(1) f^{(m)}(z) - \phi^{(n-m)}(0) f^{(m)}(a)
  }
  \\
  &
  + (-)^{n} (z-a)^{n+1}
  \int_{n}^{1} \phi(t) f^{(n+1)}(a + t(z-a)) \dmeasure t,
\end{align*}
which is the formula in question.

Taylor's series may be obtained as a special case of this by writing
$\phi(t) = (t-1)^{n}$ and making $n\rightarrow\infty$.

%\begin{smalltext}
Example. By substituting $2n$ for $n$ in the formula of Darboux, and
taking $\phi(t) = t^{n} (t-1)^{n}$, obtain the expansion (supposed convergent)
$$
f(z) - f(a)
=
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
\frac{ (-)^{n-1} (z-a)^{n} }{2^{n} n!}
\thebrace{ f^{(n)}(z) + (-)^{n-1} f^{(n)}(a) },
$$
and find the expression for the remainder after $n$ terms in this
series.
%\end{smalltext}
\Section{7}{2}{The \Bernoulli an numbers and the \Bernoulli an polynomials.}

The function $\half z \cot \half z$ is analytic when $\absval{z} <
2\pi$,
and, since it is an even function of $z$, it can be expanded into a
Maclaurin series, thus
$$
\half z \cot \half z
=
1
- B_{1} \frac{z^{2}}{2!}
- B_{2} \frac{z^{4}}{4!}
- B_{3} \frac{z^{6}}{6!}
\ cdots
;
$$
then $B_{n}$ is called the $n$th \emph{\Bernoulli an
  number}\footnote{TODO These numbers were introduced by Jakob BernouUi in bis Ars
Conjectandi, p. 97 (published posthumously, 1713).}.
It is found that\footnote{TODO Tables of the first sixty-two \Bernoulli an numbers have been given by
Adams, Brit. A.is. ReiJorts, 1877.}
$$
B_{1} = \frac{1}{6},
\quad
B_{2} = \frac{1}{30},
\quad
B_{3} = \frac{1}{42},
\quad
B_{4} = \frac{1}{30},
\quad
B_{5} = \frac{5}{66},
\quad
\ldots.
$$

%
% 126
%
These numbers can be expressed as definite integrals as follows:

We have, by example TODO:2 (p. TODO:122) of Chapter TODO:VI,
\begin{align*}
  \int_{0}^{\infty}
  \frac{\sin px \dmeasure x}{e^{\pi x} - 1}
  =&
  -\frac{1}{2p} + \frac{i}{2} \cot ip
  \\
  =&
  -\frac{1}{2p}
  +
  \frac{i}{2} \thebrace{
    1
    + B_{1} \frac{(2p)^{2}}{2!}
    - B_{2} \frac{(2p)^{4}}{4!}
    + \cdots
    }.
\end{align*}

Since
$$
\int_{0}^{\infty}
\frac{x^{n} \sin \theparen{px + \half n \pi}}{e^{\pi x} - 1}
\dmeasure
$$
converges uniformly (by de la Vall\'ee Poussin's test) near
$p=0$ we
may, by \hardsubsectionref{4}{4}{4} corollary, differentiate both
sides of this equation any number of times and then put $p = 0$; doing
so and writing $2t$ for $x$, we obtain
$$
B_{n}
=
4n
\int_{0}^{\infty}
\frac{t^{2n-1} \dmeasure t}{e^{2\pi t} - 1}.
$$
%\begin{remark}
A proof of this result, depending on contour integration, is given by
Carda, Monatshefte fur Math, v.nd Phys. v. (1894), pp. 321-4.
%\end{remark}

TODO:fixexample
Example. Shew that
$$
B_{n}
=
\frac{2n}{\pi^{2n} (2^{2n}-1)}
\int_{0}^{\infty}
\frac{x^{2n}-1}{\sinh x}
> 0.
$$

Now consider the function $t \frac{e^{zt}-1}{e^{t}-1}$, which may be
expanded into a
Maclaurin series in powers of $t$ valid when $\absval{t} < 2\pi$.

\emph{The \Bernoulli an polynomial\footnote{TODO The name was given by
    Raabe, Journal filr Math. xlii. (1851), p.348.} of order $n$} is
defined to be the coefficient of $\frac{t^{n}}{n!}$
in this expansion. It is denoted by $\phi_{n}(z)$, so that
$$
t \frac{e^{zt}-1}{e^{t}-1}
=
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
\frac{\theta_{n}(z) t^{n}}{n!}.
$$

This polynomial possesses several important properties. Writing $z+1$
for $z$ in the preceding equation and subtracting, we find that
$$
t e^{zt}
=
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
\thebrace{
  \phi_{n}(z+1) - \phi_{n}(z)
}
\frac{t^{n}}{n!}.
$$

On equating coefficients of $t^{n}$ on both
sides of this equation we obtain
$$
n z^{n-1}
=
\phi_{n}(z+1) - \phi_{n}(z),
$$
which is a difference-equation satisfied by the function $\phi_{n}(z)$.

%
% 127
%

An explicit expression for the \Bernoulli an polynomials can be obtained
as follows. We have
$$
e^{zt} - 1
=
zt
+ \frac{z^{2}t^{2}}{2!}
+ \frac{z^{3}t^{3}}{3!}
+ \cdots,
$$
and
$$
\frac{t}{e^{t}-1}
=
\frac{t}{2i} \cot \frac{t}{2i} - \frac{t}{2}
=
1
- \frac{t}{2}
+ \frac{B_{1} t^{2}}{2!}
- \frac{B_{2} t^{4}}{4!}
+ \cdots.
$$

Hence
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
\frac{\phi_{n}(z) t^{n}}{n!}
=
\thebrace{
  zt
  + \frac{z^{2} t^{2}}{2!}
  + \frac{z^{3} t^{3}}{3!}
  + \cdots
}
\thebrace{
  1
  - \frac{t}{2}
  + \frac{B_{1} t^{2}}{2!}
  - \frac{B_{2} t^{4}}{4!}
  + \cdots
}.
$$

From this, by equating coefficients of $t^{n}$
(\hardsubsectionref{3}{7}{3}), we have
$$
\phi_{n}(z)
=
z^{n}
- \half n z^{n-1}
+ \binomialcoeff{n}{2} B_{1} z^{n-2}
- \binomialcoeff{n}{4} B_{2} z^{n-4}
+ \binomialcoeff{n}{6} B_{3} z^{n-6}
- \cdots,
$$
the last term being that in $z$ or $z^{2}$ and
$\binomialcoeff{n}{2}, \binomialcoeff{n}{4},\ldots$  being the
binomial coefficients; this is the Maclaurin series for the $n$th
\Bernoulli an polynomial.
%\begin{Remark}
When $z$ is an integer, it may be seen from the difference-equation that
$$
\phi_{n}(z)/n
=
1^{n-1}
+ 2^{n-1}
+ \cdots + (z-1)^{n-1}.
$$

The Maclaurin series for the
expression on the right was given by \Bernoulli.

%\begin{Remark}
\begin{wandwexample}
  Shew that, when $n > 1$,
  $$
  \phi_{n}(z) = (-)^{n} \phi_{n}(1-z).
  $$

\Subsection{7}{2}{1}{The Euler-Maclaurin expansion.}

In the formula of Darboux \hardsectionref{7}{1}) write $\phi_{n}(t)$
for $\phi(t)$, where $\phi_{n}(t)$ is the $n$th \Bernoulli an polynomial.

Differentiating the equation
$$
\phi_{n}(t+1) - \phi_{n}(t) = n t^{n-1}
$$
$n - k$ times, we have
$$
\phi_{n}^{(n-k)}(t+1) - \phi_{n}^{(n-k)}(t)
=
n (n-t) \cdots k t^{k-1}
$$
Putting $t=0$ in this, we have
$\phi_{n}^{(n-k)}(1) = \phi_{n}^{(n-k)}(0).$

Now, from the Maclaurin
series for $\phi_{n}(z)$, we have if $k > 0$
\begin{align*}
  \phi_{n}^{(n-2k-1)}(0) = 0,
  &
  \quad
  \phi_{n}^{(n-2k)}(0) = \frac{n!}{(2k)!} (-)^{k-1} B_{k},
  \\
  \phi_{n}^{(n-1)}(0) = -\half n!,
  &
  \quad
  \phi_{n}^{(n)}(0) = n!.
\end{align*}

Substituting these values of $\phi_{n}^{(n-k)}(1)$ and
$\phi_{n}^{(n-k)}(0)$ in Darboux's
result, we obtain the Euler-Maclaurin sum
formula\footnote{TODO A history of the formula is given by Barnes, Proc. London Math. Soc.
(2), iii. (1905), p. 253. It was discovered by Euler (1732), but was
not published at the time. Euler communicated it (June 9, 1730) to
Stirling who replied (April 16, 1738) that it included his own theorem
(see \hardsubsectionref{12}{3}{3}) as a particular case, and also that the more general
theorem had been discovered by Maclaurin; and Euler, in a lengthy
reply, waived his claims to priority. The theorem was published by
Euler, Comm. Acad. Imp. Petrop. vi. (1732), [Published 1738], pp.
68-97, and by Maclaurin in 1742, Treatise on Fluxions, p. 672. For
information concerning the correspondence between Euler and Stirling,
we are indebted to Mr C. Tweedie.},

\begin{align*}
(z-a) f'(a)
=&
f(z) - f(a)
- \frac{z-a}{2} \thebrace{ f'(z) - f'(a) }
\\
&
+ \sum_{m=1}^{n-1} \frac{ (-)^{m-1} B_{m} (z-a)^{2m}}{(2m)!}
\thebrace{f^{(2m)}(z) - f^{(2m)}(a)}

\int_{0}^{1} \phi_{(2n)}(t) f^{(2n+1)}\thebrace{ a + (z-a) t }
\dmeasure t.
\end{align*}

In certain cases the last term tends to zero as
$n \rightarrow \infty$, and we can
thus obtain an infinite series for $f(z) - f(a)$.

If we write $\omega$ for $z - a$ and $F(x)$ for $f'(x)$, the last formula becomes
\begin{align*}
  \int_{a}^{a+\omega} F(x) \dmeasure x
  =
  &
  \half \omega \thebrace{ F(a) + F(a + \omega) }
  \\
  &
  + \sum_{m=1}^{n-1}
  \frac{(-)^{m} B_{m} \omega^{2m}}{(2m)!}

  \\
  &
  + \frac{\omega^{2n+1}}{(2n)!}
  \int_{0}^{1} \phi_{2n}(t) F^{(2n)}(a + \omega t) \dmeasure t.
\end{align*}

Writing $a + \omega, a + 2\omega, \ldots, a + (r-1) \omega$
for $a$ in this result and adding up, we get
\begin{align*}
\int_{a}^{a + r\omega} F(x) \dmeasure x
=
\omega
 &
\thebrace{
  \half F(a) + F(a+\omega) + F(a+2\omega)
  + \cdots + \half F(a + r\omega)
}
\\
&
+ \sum_{m=1}^{n-1}
\frac{(-)^{m} B_{m} \omega^{2m}}{(2m)!}
\thebrace{
  F^{(2m-1)}(a + r\omega)
  -
  F^{(2m-1)}(a)
}
+ R_{n}
\end{align*}
where
$$
R_{n}
=
\frac{\omega^{2n+1}}{(2n)!}
\int_{0}^{1} \phi_{2n}(t)
\thebrace{ \sum_{m=0}^{r-1} F^{(2n)}(a + m\omega + \omega t)}
\dmeasure t.
$$

This last formula is of the utmost importance in connexion with the
numerical evaluation of definite integrals. It is valid if $F(x)$ is
analytic at all points of the straight line joining
$a$ to $a + r \omega$.

\Section{7}{3}{\Burmann's theorem*TODO * Memoires de VInstitut, ii. (1799), p. 13. See also Dixon, Proc.
London Math. Soc. xxxiv. (1902), pp. 151-153..}

We shall next consider several theorems which have for their object
\emph{the expansion of one function in powers of another function.}

%
% 129
%

Let $\phi(z)$ be a function of $z$ which is analytic in a closed
region $S$ of which $a$ is an interior point; and let
$$
\phi(a) = b.
$$

Suppose also that $\phi'(a) \neq 0$. Then Taylor's theorem furnishes the
expansion
$$
\phi(z) - b
=
\phi'(a) (z-a)
+ \half \phi''(a) (z-a)^{2}
+ \cdots,
$$
and if it is legitimate to revert this series we obtain
$$
z - a
=
\frac{1}{\phi'(a)}
\thebrace{ \phi(z) - b }
-
\half \frac{\phi''(a)}{\thebrace{\phi'(a)}^{3}}
\thebrace{ \phi(z) - b }^{2}
+ \cdots,
$$
which expresses $z$ as an analytic function of the variable
$\thebrace{ \phi(z) - b }$,
for sufficiently small values of $\absval{z-a}$. If then $f(z)$ be
analytic near $z = a$, it follows that $f(z)$ is an analytic function
of $\thebrace{ \phi(z) - b }$
when $\absval{z - a}$ is sufficiently small, and so there will be an
expansion of the form
$$
f(z)
=
f(a)
+ a_{1} \thebrace{ \phi(z) - b }
+ \frac{a_{2}}{2!} \thebrace{ \phi(z) - b }^{2}
+ \frac{a_{3}}{3!} \thebrace{ \phi(z) - b }^{3}
+ \cdots.
$$

The actual coefficients in the expansion are given by the following
theorem, which is generally known as \emph{\Burmann's theorem}.

\emph{Let $\psi(z)$ be a function of $z$ defined by the equation
$$
\psi(z) = \frac{z-a}{ \phi(z) - b };
$$
then an analytic function $f(z)$ can, in a certain domain of values of
$z$, be expanded in the form
$$
f(z)
=
f(a)
+
\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}
\frac{ \thebrace{\phi(z)-b}^{m} }{m!}
\frac{\dd^{m-1}}{\dd a^{m-1}}
\thebracket{
  f'(a) \psi^{m}(a)
}
+
R_{n},
$$
where
$$
R_{n}
=
\frac{1}{2 \pi i}
\int_{a}^{z}
\int_{\gamma}
\thebracket{
  \frac{\phi(z) - b}{\phi(t) - b}
}^{n-1}
\frac{ f'(t) \phi'(z) }{\phi(t) - \phi(z)}
\dmeasure t \dmeasure z,
$$
and $\gamma$ is a contour in the $t$-plane, enclosing the points $a$
and $z$ and such that, if $\zeta$ be any point inside it, the equation
$\phi(t) = \phi(\zeta)$ has no roots on or inside the contour
except\footnote{It is assumed that such a contour can be chosen if
  $\absval{z - a}$ be sufficiently small;
  see\hardsubsectionref{7}{3}{1}.} a simple root $t=\zeta$.
}

To prove this, we have
\begin{align*}
  f(z) - f(a)
  = &
  \int_{a}^{z} f'(\zeta) \dmeasure \zeta
  = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{a}^{z} \int_{\phi} TODO
\end{align*}

%
% 130
%

But, by\hardsectionref{4}{3},
\begin{align*}
  &
  \frac{1}{1 \pi i}
  \int_{a}^{z} \int_{\gamma}
  \thebracket{ \frac{\phi(\zeta) - b}{\phi(t) - b} }^{m}
  \frac{f'(t)\phi'(\zeta)}{\phi(t) - b}
  \dmeasure t \dmeasure \zeta
  \\
  &=
  \frac{ [\phi(z) - b]^{m+1}] }{2 \pi i (m+1)}
  \int_{\gamma} \frac{f'(t)}{[\phi(t) - b]^{m+1}} \dmeasure t
  \\
  &=
  \frac{ [\phi(z) - b]^{m+1}] }{2 \pi i (m+1)}
  \int_{\gamma}
  \frac{ f'(t) [\psi(t)]^{m+1} }{ (t-a)^{m+1} }
  \dmeasure t
  \\
  &=
  \frac{ [\phi(z) - b ]^{m+1} }{ (m+1)! }
  \frac{ \dd^{m} }{ \dd a^{m} }
  \thebracket{ f'(a) \thebrace{\psi(a)}^{m+1} }.
\end{align*}
Therefore, writing
$m - 1$ for $m$,
\begin{align*}
  f(z) = f(a) +
  &
  \sum_{m=1}^{n-1}
  \frac{ [\phi(z) - b]^{m} }{m!}
  \frac{\dd^{m-1}}{\dd a^{m-1}}
  [ f'(a) \thebrace{ \psi(a) }^{m} ]
  \\
  &
  \frac{1}{2 \pi i}
  \int_{a}^{z} \int_{\gamma}
  \thebracket{
    \frac{\phi(\zeta) - b}{\phi(t) - b}
  }^{n-1}
  \frac{f'(t) \phi'(\zeta)}{\phi(t) - \phi(\zeta)}
  \dmeasure t \dmeasure \zeta.
\end{align*}

If the last integral tends to zero as $n \rightarrow \infty$, we may write the
right-hand side of this equation as an infinite series.
\begin{wandwexample}
Prove that
$$
z
=
a
+ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
\frac{(-)^{n-1} C_{n} (z-a)^{n} e^{n (z^{2} - a^{2}}}{n!},
$$
where
$$
C_{n}
=
(2na)^{n-1}
- \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1!} (2na)^{n-3}
+ \frac{n^{2}(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)}{2!} (2na)^{n-5}
- \cdots.
$$
To obtain this expansion, write
$$
f(z) = z,
\quad
\phi(z) - b = (z-a) e^{z^{2} - a^{2}},
\quad
\psi(z) = e^{a^{2} - z^{2}}
$$
in the above expression
of \Burmann's theorem; we thus have
$$
z
=
a
+ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
\frac{1}{n!}
(z-a)^{n}
e^{n(z^{2} - a^{2})}
\thebrace{
  \frac{\dd^{n-1}}{\dd z^{n-1}}
  e^{n(a^{2} - z^{2})}
}_{z=a}.
$$

But, putting $z = a + t$,
\begin{align*}
  \thebrace{
    \frac{\dd^{n-1}}{\dd z^{n-1}}
    e^{n(a^{2} - z^{2})}
  }_{z=a}
  =&
  \thebrace{
    \frac{\dd^{n-1}}{\dd t^{n-1}}
    e^{-n(2at + t^{2})}
  }_{t=0}
  \\
  =&
  TOOD
\end{align*}
The highest value of $r$ which gives a term in the summation is
$r = n-1$.
Arranging therefore the summation in descending indices $r$,
beginning with $r = n-1$, we have
\begin{align*}
  \thebrace{
    \frac{\dd^{n-1}}{\dd z^{n-1}}
    e^{n(a^{2} - z^{2})}
  }_{z=a}
  =&
  TODO
  \\
  =& (-)^{n-1} C_{n},
\end{align*}
which gives the required result.

\Subsection{7}{3}{1}{\Teixeira's extended form of \Burmann's theorem.}

In the last section we have not investigated closely the conditions of
convergence of \Burmann's series, for the reason that a much more
general form of the theorem will next be stated; this generalisation
bears the same relation to the theorem just given that Laurent's
theorem bears to Taylor's theorem: viz., in the last paragraph we
were concerned only with the expansion of a function in \emph{positive}
powers of smother function, whereas we shall now discuss the expansion
of a function in \emph{positive and negative} powers of the second
function.

The general statement of the theorem is due to
\Teixeira\footnote{TODO Journal f\"ur Math, cxxii. (1900), pp.
  97-123.}, whose exposition we shall follow in this section.

Suppose (i) that $f(z)$ is a function of $z$ analytic in a ring-shaped
region $A$, bounded by an outer curve $C$ and an inner curve $c$;
(ii) that $\theta(z)$ is a function analytic on and inside $C$,
and has only one zero a
within this contour, the zero being a simple one;
(iii) that $x$; is a given point within $A$;
(iv) that for all points $z$ of $C$ we have
$$
\absval{\theta(x)} < \absval{\theta(z)},
$$
and for all points $z$ of $c$ we have
$$
\absval{\theta(x)} > \absval{\theta(z)}.
$$

The equation
$$
\theta(z) - \theta(x) = 0
$$
has, in this case, a single root $z = x$ in the interior of $C$, as is
seen from the equation\footnote{The expansion is justified
  by\hardsectionref{4}{7}, since
  $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \thebrace{\theta(x)/\theta(z)}^{n}$
  converges uniformly when $z$
  is on $C$.}
\begin{align*}
  \frac{1}{2 \pi i}
  \int_{C} \frac{\theta'(z)}{\theta(z) - \theta(x)} \dmeasure z
  =&
  \frac{1}{2 \pi i}
  \thebracket{
    \int_{C} \frac{\theta'(z)}{\theta(z)} \dmeasure z
    +
    \theta(x)
    \int_{C} \frac{\theta'(z)}{ \thebrace{\theta(z)}^{2}}
    \dmeasure z
    + \cdots
  }
  \\
  =&
  \int{1}{2 \pi i}
  \int_{C} \frac{\theta'(z)}{\theta(z)} \dmeasure z
\end{align*}
of which the left-hand and right-hand members represent respectively
the number of roots of the equation considered
(\hardsubsectionref{6}{3}{1}) and the
number of the roots of the equation $\theta(z) = 0$ contained within
$C$.

Cauchy's theorem therefore gives
$$
f(x)

if we write $\theta_{1}(z) = 1 / \phi(z)$:

\emph{Let $f(z)$ and $\phi(z)$ he functions of $z$ analytic on and inside a

is satisfied at all points $z$ on the perimeter of $C$;
then the equation
$$
\zeta = a + t \phi(\zeta),

regarded as an equation in $\zeta$, has one root in the interior
of $C$; and further any function of $\zeta$ analytic on and inside
$C$ can be expanded as a power series in $t$ by the formula

\Section{7}{4}{The expansion of a class of functions in rational fractions*'.}
Consider a function $f(z)$, whose only singularities in the finite
part of the plane are simple poles $a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots$, where
$\absval{a_{1}} \leq \absval{a_{2}} \leq \absval{a_{3}} \leq \cdots$;
let $b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},\ldots$, be the residues at these
poles, and let it be possible to choose a sequence of circles $C_{m}$ (the
radius of $C_{m}$ being $R_{m}$) vvith centre at $O$, not passing through any
poles, such that $\absval{f(z)}$ is bounded on $C_{m}$. (The function
$\cosec z$ may
be cited as an example of the class of functions considered, and we
take $R_{m} = (m + \half)\pi$.) Suppose further that
$R_{m} \rightarrow \infty$ as $m \rightarrow \infty$ and that
the upper bound\footnote{Which is a function of $m$.}
of $\absval{f(z)}$ on $C_{m}$ is itself bounded
as\footnote{Of course $R_{m}$ need not (and frequently must not) tend to infinity
  continuously; e.g. in the example taken
  $R_{m} = (m+\half)z$, where $m$ assumes only integer values.}
$m\rightarrow\infty$; so
that, for all points on the circle $C_{m}$, $\absval{f(z)} < M$, where $M$ is
independent of $m$.

Then, if $x$ be not a pole of $f(z)$, since the only poles of the
integrand are the poles of $f(z)$ and the point $z = x$, we have, by\hardsectionref{6}{1},
$$
\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{C_{m}} \frac{f(z)}{z-x} \dmeasure z
=
f(x) + \sum_{r} \frac{b_{r}}{a_{r}-x}.
$$
where the summation extends over all poles in the interior of C, .

But
\begin{align*}
  \frac{1}{2 \pi i}
  \int_{C_{m}} \frac{f(z)}{z-x} \dmeasure z
  =&
  \frac{1}{2 \pi i}
  \int_{C_{m}} \frac{f(z)}{z} \dmeasure z
  +
  \frac{x}{2 \pi i}
  \int_{C_{m}} \frac{f(x)}{z(z-x)} \dmeasure z
  \\
  =&
  f(0) + \sum_{r} \frac{b_{r}}{a_{r}}
  +
  \frac{x}{2 \pi i}
  \int_{C_{m}} \frac{f(z)}{z(z-x)} \dmeasure x
\end{align*}
if we suppose the function $f(z)$ to be analytic at the origin.

Now as $m \rightarrow \infty$,
$\int_{C_{m}} \frac{f(z)}{z(z-x)} \dmeasure z$ is
$\bigo(R_{m}^{-1})$, and so tends to zero as
$m$ tends to infinity.

Therefore, making $m \rightarrow \infty$, we have
$$
0
=
f(x) - f(0)
+
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
b_{n} \theparen{
  \frac{1}{a_{n}-x} - \frac{1}{a_{n}}
}
-
\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}
\frac{x}{2 \pi i}
\int_{C_{m}} \frac{f(z)}{z(z-x)} \dmeasure x,
$$
\ie
$$
f(x) = f(0)
+
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}
b_{n}
\thebrace{
  \frac{1}{x-a_{n}} + \frac{1}{a_{n}}
  %TODO:consistent with above?
}
$$
which is an expansion of $f(x)$ in rational fractions of $x$; and the
summation extends over \emph{all} the poles of $f(x)$.

%\begin{smalltext}
If $\absval{a_{n}} < \absval{a_{n+1}}$ this series converges uniformly
throughout the region given by $\absval{x} < a$, where $a$ is any constant
(except near the points $a_{n}$).
For if $R_{m}$ be the radius of the circle which encloses the points 
$\absval{a_{1}}, \ldots, \absval{a_{n}}$,
the modulus of the remainder of the terms of the series after the first $n$ is
$$
\absval{ \frac{x}{2 \pi i}
  \int_{C_{m}} \frac{f(z)}{z(z-x)} \dmeasure z
}
< \frac{Ma}{R_{m}-a},
$$
by\hardsubsectionref{4}{6}{2}; and, given
$\eps$, we can choose $n$ \emph{independent} of $x$
such that $Ma/(R_{m}-a) < \eps$.

* Mittag-Leffler, Acta Soc. Scient. Fennicae, xi. (1880), pp. 273-293.
See also Acta Math. iv. (1884), pp. 1-79.

%
% 135
%

The convergence is obviously still uniform even if 
$\absval{a_{n}} \leq \absval{a_{n+1}}$
provided the terms of the series are grouped so as to combine the
terms corresponding to poles of equal moduli.

If, instead of the condition $\absval{f(z)} < M$, we have the
condition $\absval{ z^{-p} f(z) } < M$,
where $M$ is independent of $m$ when $z$ is on $C_{m}$, and $p$ is
a positive integer, then we should have to
expand $\int_{C} \frac{f(z)}{z-x} \dmeasure z$ by writing
$$
\frac{1}{z-x}
=
\frac{1}{z}
+ \frac{x}{z^{2}}
+ \cdots
+ \frac{x^{p+1}}{z^{p+1}(z-x)},
$$
and should obtain a similar but somewhat more complicated expansion.
\begin{wandwexample}
Prove that
$$
\cosec z
=
\frac{1}{z}
+
\sum (-)^{n}
\theparen{\frac{1}{z-n\pi} + \frac{1}{n\pi}}
$$
the summation extending to all positive and negative values of $n$.

To obtain this result, let $\cosec z - \frac{1}{z} = f(z)$.
The singularities of this function are at the
points $z=n\pi$, where $n$ is any positive or negative integer.

The residue of $f(z)$ at the singularity $n\pi$ is therefore
$(-)^{n}$, and the reader will easily see that $\absval{f(z)}$ is
bounded on the circle $\absval{z} = (n + \half) \pi$ as
$n \rightarrow \infty$.

Applying now the general theorem
$$
f(z)
=
f(0)
+
\sum c_{n} \thebracket{ \frac{1}{z-a_{n}} + \frac{1}{a_{n}}  },
$$
where $c_{n}$ is the residue at the singularity $a_{n}$, we have
$$
f(z)
=
f(0)
+
\sum (-)^{n} \thebrace{ \frac{1}{z-n\pi} + \frac{1}{n\pi}  }.
$$

But
$$
f(0)
=
\lim_{z \rightarrow 0} \frac{z - \sin z}{z \sin z} = 0.
$$

Therefore 
$$
\cosec z
=
\frac{1}{z}
+
\sum (-)^{n} \thebracket{ \frac{1}{z-n\pi} + \frac{1}{n\pi}  },
$$
which is the required result.
\end{wandwexample}
\begin{wandwexample}
If $0<a<1$, shew that
$$
\frac{e^{az}}{e^{z}-1}
=
\frac{1}{z}

\sum_{n=1}
\frac{2z \cos 2na\pi - 4n\pi \sin 2na\pi}{z^{2}+4n^{2}\pi^{2}}.
$$
\end{wandwexample}
\begin{wandwexample}
Prove that
$$
\frac{1}{2 \pi x^{2} (\cosh x - \cos x)}

-
\frac{3}{e^{3 \pi}-e^{-3 \pi}}
\frac{1}{(3 \pi)^{4} + \frac{1}{4} x^{4}}
+
\cdots.
$$

The general term of the series on the right is
$$
\frac{(-)^{r} r}{(e^{r \pi}-e^{-r \pi})
  \thebrace{(r \pi)^{4} + \frac{1}{4} x^{4}}}
$$
which is the residue at each of the four singularities
$r, -r, ri, -ri$ of the function
$$
\frac{\pi z}{(\pi^{4}z^{4} + \frac{1}{4} x^{4}) (e^{\pi z} - e^{-\pi
    z}) \sin \pi z}.
$$

%
% 136
%

The singularities of this latter function which are not of the type
$r, -r, ri, -ri$ are at the five points
$$
0,
\frac{(\pm 1 \pm i) x}{2 \pi}.
$$
At $z=0$ the residue is
$$
\frac{2}{\pi x^{4}};
$$
at each of the four points
$\frac{(\pm 1 \pm i) x}{2 \pi}$, the residue is

\Section{7}{5}{The expansion of a class of functions as

The theorem of the last article can be applied to the expansion of a

It follows immediately that at each of the points a, the function .
has a simple pole, with residue + 1.

If then we can find a sequence of circles C\ n of the nature described
in

the

expansion given in § 7 '4, that

f z) f 0) n = \ [Z - an Clr.

Since this series converges uniformly when the terms are suitably

taking the exponential of each side, we get

/( ) = ce/( ) " n (1 e 4,

where c is independent of z.

Putting z = 0, we see that /(O) = c, and thus the general result
becomes

\Subsection{7}{8}{1}{Borel's integral and analytic continuation.}

We next obtain Borel's result that his integral represents an analytic
function in a more extended region than the interior of the circle \
z\ = r.

This extended region is obtained as follows : take the singularities
a,b,c,... of f(z) and through each of them draw a line perpendicular
to the line joining that singularity to the origin. The lines so drawn
will divide the plane into regions of which one is a polygon with the
origin inside it.

Then Borel's integral represents an analytic function (which, by\hardsectionref{5}{5}
and\hardsectionref{7}{8}, is obviously that defined by f(z) and its continuations)
throughout the interior of this polygon. The reader will observe that
this is the first actual formula obtained for the analytic
continuation of a function, except the trivial one of § 5 '5, example.

For, take any point P with affix ( inside the polygon; then the circle
on GF as diameter has no singularity on or inside it*; and
consequently we can draw a slightly

* The reader will see this from the figure; for if there were such a
singularity the correspond- ing side of the polygon would pass between
and P; i.e. P would be outside the polygon.

but 2 C -Llf converges imiformly \hardsubsectionref{3}{3}{4}) on C since f(z) is bounded
and l 2 j 8 > 0, where S is independent of z; therefore, by\hardsectionref{4}{7},

c (C0 = 2 - I -\ f .z) exp Ctz-') dz,

and so, when t is real, | (CO i < (0 < where F (0 is bounded in any
closed region lying wholly inside the polygon and is independent of t
; and \ is the greatest value of the real part of (jz on C.

If we draw the circle traced out l)y the point 2/, we see that the
real part of f/2 is gi-eatest when z is at the extremity of the
diameter through (, and so the value of X is

1C|. ICI + S - <1.

We can get a similar inequality for ( ' (CO and hence, by\hardsubsectionref{5}{3}{2}, |
e~' (CO t is

.' analytic at ( and is obviously a one-valued function of C-

This is the result stated above.
\Subsection{7}{8}{2}{Expansions in series of inverse factorials.}

A mode of development of functions, which, after being used by Nicole
f and Stirling:]: in the eighteenth century, was systematically
investigated by Schlomilch§ in 1863, is that of expansion in a series
of inverse factorials.

To obtain such an expansion of a function analytic when \ z r, we let

the function he f z)= X "h "", and use the formula /( ) = I ze~ t)dt,
=o '0

where (f> t)= S anV j n !); this result may be obtained in the same
way as
