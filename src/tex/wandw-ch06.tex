\chapter{The Theory of Residues; Application to the Evaluation of Definite Integrals} 

\Section{6}{1}{Residues}

If the function $f(z)$ has a pole of order $m$ at $z=a$, then, by the
definition of a pole, an equation of the form
$$
f(z)
=
\frac{a_{-m}}{ (z-a)^{m} }
+ \frac{ a_{-m+1} }{ (z-a)^{m-1} }
+ \cdots
+ \frac{a_{-1}}{z-a}
+ \phi(z),
$$
where $\phi(z)$ is analytic near and at $a$, is true near $a$.

The coefficient $a_{-1}$ in this expansion is called the \emph{residue}\index{Residues!defined} of the
function $f(z)$ relative to the pole $a$.

Consider now the value of the integral $\int_{\alpha} f(z) \dmeasure z$, where the path of
integration is a circle\footnote{The existence of such a circle is
  implied in the definition of a pole as an isolated singularity.}
$\alpha$, whose centre is the point $a$ and whose radius $\rho$ is so small
that $\phi(z)$ is analytic inside and on the circle.

We have
$$
\int_{\alpha} f(z) \dmeasure z
=
\sum_{r=1}^{m}
a_{r}
\int_{\alpha} \frac{\dmeasure z}{ (z-a)^{r}}
+
\int_{\alpha} \phi(z) \dmeasure z.
$$

Now $\int_{\alpha} \phi(z) \dmeasure z = 0$ by \hardsectionref{5}{2};
and (putting $z-a = \rho e^{i\theta}$) we have, if $r \neq 1$,
$$
\int_{\alpha} \frac{ \dmeasure z}{ (z-a)^{r} }
=
\int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{\rho e^{i\theta} i \dmeasure \theta}{ \rho^{r}
  e^{ri\theta}}
=
\rho^{-r+1}
\int_{0}^{2\pi} e^{(1-r)i\theta} i \dmeasure \theta
=
\rho^{-r+1}
\thebracket{ \frac{e^{(1-r) i \theta}}{1-r} }_{0}^{2\pi}
=
0.
$$

But, when $r = 1$, we have
$$
\int_{\alpha}
\frac{\dmeasure z}{z - a}
=
\int_{0}^{2\pi} i \dmeasure \theta
=
2\pi i.
$$

Hence finally
$$
\int_{\alpha} f(z) \dmeasure z = 2 \pi i a_{-1}.
$$

Now let $C$ be any contour, containing in the region interior to it a
number of poles $a,b,c,\ldots$ of a function $f(z)$, with residues
$a_{-1}, b_{-1}, c_{-1},\ldots$
respectively; and suppose that the function $f(z)$ is
analytic throughout $C$ and its interior, except at these poles.

Surround the points $a,b,c,\ldots$ by circles
$\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\ldots$
so small that their respective centres are the only singularities
inside or on each circle; then the function $f(z)$ is analytic in the
closed region bounded by $C$, $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\ldots$.
%
% 112
%

Hence, by \hardsectionref{5}{2} corollary TODO,
\begin{align*}
  \int_{C} f(z) \dmeasure z
  =&
  \int_{\alpha} f(z) \dmeasure z
  + \int_{\beta} f(z) \dmeasure z
  + \cdots
  \\
  =&
  2\pi i a_{-1} + 2\pi i b_{-1} + \cdots.
\end{align*}

Thus we have the \emph{theorem of residues}, namely that
\emph{if $f(z)$ be analytic throughout a contour $C$ and its interior
  except at a number of poles inside the contour, then
  $$
  \int_{C} f(z) \dmeasure z = 2\pi i \sum R,
  $$
where $\sum R$ denotes the sum of the residues of the function $f(z)$ at
those of its poles which are situated within the contour $C$.}

This is an extension of the theorem of \hardsubsectionref{5}{2}{1}.

%\begin{Remark} TODO:\alpha or a?
Note. If $a$ is a simple pole of $f(z)$ the residue of $f(z)$ at that pole
is $\lim_{z\rightarrow a} (z-a) f(z)$.
%\end{Remark}

\Section{6}{2}{The evaluation of definite integrals.}

We shall now apply the result of \hardsectionref{6}{1} to evaluating
various classes of definite integrals; the methods to be employed in
any particular case may usually be seen from the following typical
examples.

\Subsection{6}{2}{1}{The evaluation of the integrals of certain
  periodic functions taken between the limits $0$ and
  $2\pi$.\index{Integrals!of periodic functions}\index{Periodic
    functions!integrals involving}}
An integral of the type
$$
\int_{0}^{2\pi} R(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) \dmeasure \theta,\index{Trigonometrical integrals}
$$
where the integrand is a rational function of $\cos\theta$ and
$\sin\theta$ finite on the range of integration, can be evaluated by
writing $e^{i\theta}=z$; since
$$
\cos\theta = \half(z+z^{-1}),
\quad
\sin\theta = \frac{1}{2i} (z-z^{-1}),
$$
the integral takes the form $\int_{C} S(z) \dmeasure z$, where $S(z)$
is a rational function of $z$ finite on the path of integration $C$, the
circle of radius unity whose centre is the origin.

Therefore, by \hardsectionref{6}{1}, \emph{the integral is equal to
  $2\pi i$ times the sum of the residues of $S(z)$ at those of its
  poles which are inside that circle.}

\begin{wandwexample}
  If $0 < p < 1$,
  $$
  \int_{0}^{2\pi}
  \frac{\dmeasure \theta}{ 1 - 2p\cos\theta + p^{2}}
  =
  \int_{C} \frac{ \dmeasure z}{ i (1-pz) (z-p) }.
  $$
  The only pole of the integrand inside the circle is a simple pole at
  $p$; and the residue there is
  $$
  \lim_{z \rightarrow p} \frac{z-p}{ i (1-pz)(z-p)}
  =
  \frac{1}{i (1-p^{2})}.
  $$
  % 
  % 113
  % 
  Hence
  $$
  \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{\dmeasure\theta}{1 - 2p\cos\theta + p^{2}}
  =
  \frac{2\pi}{1-p^{2}}.
  $$
\end{wandwexample}

\begin{wandwexample}
  If $0 < p < 1$,
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{ \cos^{2} 3\theta}{1-2p\cos 2\theta + p^{2}}
    \dmeasure \theta
    =&
    \int_{C} \frac{\dmeasure z}{iz}
    \theparen{ \half z^{3} + \half z^{-3}}^{2}
    \frac{1}{ (1-pz^{2})(1-pz^{-2})}
  \end{align*}
  where $\sum R$ denotes the sum of the residues of
  $ \frac{ (z^{6} + 1)^{2} }{ 4z^{5} (1-pz^{2})(z^{2}-p)} $ at its poles
  inside $C$; these poles are $0, -p^{\half}, p^{\half}$;
  and the residues at them are
  $ -\frac{1+p^{2}+p^{4}}{4p^{3}},
  \frac{(p^{3}+1)^{2}}{ 8p^{3}(1-p^{2})},
  \frac{(p^{3}+1)^{2}}{ 8p^{3}(1-p^{2})}$; %TODO:same?
  and hence the integral is equal to
  $$
  \frac{\pi (1-p+p^{2})}{1-p}.
  $$
\end{wandwexample}
\begin{wandwexample}
  If $n$ be a positive integer,
  $$
  \int_{0}^{2\pi} e^{\cos\theta} \cos(n\theta - \sin\theta)
  \dmeasure \theta
  =
  \frac{2\pi}{n!},
  \quad
  \int_{0}^{2\pi}
  e^{\cos\theta} \sin(n\theta - \sin\theta) \dmeasure \theta
  =
  0.
  $$
\end{wandwexample}
\begin{wandwexample}
  If $a>b>0$,
  $$
  \int_{0}^{2\pi}
  \frac{\dmeasure \theta}{ (a+b\cos\theta)^{2}}
  =
  \frac{2\pi a}{ (a^{2}-b^{2})^{3/2} },
  \quad
  \int_{0}^{2\pi}
  \frac{\dmeasure\theta}{ (a+b\cos^{2}\theta)^{2}}
  =
  \frac{\pi(2a+b)}{ a^{3/2} (a+b)^{3/2}}.
  $$
\end{wandwexample}
\Subsection{6}{2}{2}{The evaluation of certain types of integrals
  taken between the limits $-\infty$ and $+\infty$.}
We shall now evaluate $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} Q(x) \dmeasure x$,
where $Q(z)$ is a function such that (i) it is analytic when the
imaginary part of $z$ is positive or zero (except at a finite number
of poles), (ii) it has no poles on the real axis and (iii) as
$\absval{z}\rightarrow\infty$, $zQ(z) \rightarrow 0$ uniformly for all
values of $\arg z$ such that $0 \leq \arg z \leq \pi$; provided that
(iv) when $x$ is real, $x Q(x) \rightarrow 0$, as
$x \rightarrow \pm\infty$, in such a way\footnote{The condition
  $x Q(x)\rightarrow 0$ is not in itself sufficient to secure the
  convergence of 
  $\int^{\infty} Q(x) \dmeasure x$;
  consider $Q(x) = (x \log x)^{-1}$.}
that $\int_{0}^{\infty} Q(x) \dmeasure x$ and
$\int_{-\infty}^{0} Q(x) \dmeasure x$ both converge.

Given $\eps$, we can choose $\rho_{0}$ (independent of $\arg z$) such
that $\absval{z Q(z)} < \eps/\pi$ whenever
$\absval{z} > \rho_{0}$ and $0 \leq \arg z \leq \pi$.

Consider $\int_{C} Q(z) \dmeasure z$ taken round a contour $C$
consisting of the part of the real axis joining the points $\pm\rho$
(where $\rho > \rho_{0}$) and a semicircle $\Gamma$, of radius $\rho$,
having its centre at the origin, above the real axis.

Then, by \hardsectionref{6}{1}, $\int_{C} Q(z) \dmeasure z = 2 \pi i
\sum R$, where $\sum R$ denotes the sum of the residues of $Q(z)$ at
its poles above the real axis.\footnote{$Q(z)$ has no poles above the
  real axis outside the contour.}

%
% 114
%
Therefore
$$
\absval{
  \int_{-\rho}^{\rho} Q(z) \dmeasure z
  -
  2 \pi i \sum R
}
=
\absval{
  \int_{\Gamma} Q(z) \dmeasure z
}.
$$

In the last integral write $z = \rho e^{i\theta}$, and then
\begin{align*}
  \absval{ \int_{\Gamma} Q(z) \dmeasure z  }
  &=
  \absval{
    \int_{0}^{\pi} Q(\rho e^{i\theta}) \rho e^{i\theta} i
    \dmeasure\theta
  }
  \\
  &<
  \int_{0}^{\pi} (\eps / \pi) \dmeasure \theta
  \\
  &= \eps
\end{align*}
by \hardsubsectionref{4}{6}{2}.

Hence 
$$
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\infty}
\int_{-\rho}^{\rho} Q(z) \dmeasure z
=
2\pi i \sum R.
$$

But the meaning of $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} Q(x) \dmeasure x$;
is $\lim_{\rho,\sigma\rightarrow\infty}\int_{-\rho}^{\sigma} Q(x)
\dmeasure x$;
and since
$\lim_{\sigma\rightarrow\infty}\int_{0}^{\sigma} Q(x) \dmeasure x$
and
$\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\infty}\int_{-\rho}^{0} Q(x) \dmeasure x$
both exist, this double limit is the same as
$\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\infty}\int_{-\rho}^{\rho} Q(x) \dmeasure x$.

Hence we have proved that
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} Q(x) \dmeasure x = 2\pi i \sum R.
$$

This theorem is particularly useful in the special case when $Q(x)$ is a
rational function.

%\begin{smallfont}
[Note. Even if condition (iv) is not satisfied, we still have
$$
\int_{0}^{\infty}
\thebrace{
  Q(x) + Q(-x)
} \dmeasure x
=
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\infty} \int_{-\rho}^{\rho} Q(x) \dmeasure x
= 2 \pi i \sum R.]

\begin{wandwexample}
  The only pole of $(z^{2} + 1)^{-3}$ in the upper half plane is a
  pole at $z=i$ with residue there $-\frac{3}{16} i$. Therefore

  =
  \frac{3}{8} \pi.

\Subsubsection[Jordan's lemma.]{6}{2}{2}{2}{Jordan's lemma.\footnote{TODO:Jordan, Cours d'Aiiahjse, ii. (1894), pp. 285, 286.}\index{Jordan's lemma}}

The results of \hardsubsubsectionref{6}{2}{2}{1} are true if $Q(z)$ be
subject to the less stringent condition $Q(z) \rightarrow 0$ uniformly
when
$O \leq \arg z \leq \pi$ as $\absval{z} \rightarrow \infty$ in
place of the condition $z Q(z) \rightarrow 0$ uniformly.

To prove this we require a theorem known as Jordan's lemma, viz.

\emph{If $Q(z) \rightarrow 0$ uniformly with regard to $\arg z$ as
  $\absval{z} \rightarrow \infty$ when $0 \leq \arg z \leq \pi$,
  and if $Q(z)$ is analytic when both $\absval{z} > c$ (a constant)
  and $0 \leq \arg z \leq \pi$, then
  $$
  \lim_{\rho\rightarrow\infty}
  \theparen{ \int_{\Gamma} e^{miz} Q(z) \dmeasure z  }
  =
  0,
  $$
  where $\Gamma$ is a semicircle of radius $\rho$ above the real axis with centre at
  the origin.}

Given $\eps$, choose $\rho_{0}$ so that $\absval{Q(z)} < \eps/\pi$
when $\absval{z} > \rho_{0}$ and
$0 \leq \arg z \leq \pi$;
then, if $\rho > \rho_{0}$,
$$
\absval{ \int_{\Gamma} e^{miz} Q(z) \dmeasure z }
=
\absval{
  \int_{0}^{\pi}
  e^{mi (\rho \cos\theta + i\rho \sin\theta)}
  Q(\rho e^{i\theta})
  \rho e^{i \theta}
  i \dmeasure \theta
}.
$$
But $\absval{ e^{mi\rho\cos\theta} } = 1$, and so
\begin{align*}
  \absval{ \int_{\Gamma} e^{miz} Q(z) \dmeasure z }
  <&
  \int_{0}^{\pi} (\eps/\pi) \rho e^{-m\rho\sin\theta} \dmeasure\theta
  \\
  =&
  (2\eps/\pi)
  \int_{0}^{\half\pi} \rho e^{-m\rho\sin\theta} \dmeasure\theta.
\end{align*}

Now $\sin\theta \geq 2\theta/\pi$, when\footnote{This inequality
  appears obvious when we draw the graphs $y = \sin x$, $y = 2x/\pi$;
  it may be proved by shewing that $(\sin\theta)/\theta$ decreases as
  $\theta$ increases from $0$ to $\half\pi$.
} $0 \leq \theta \leq \half\pi$, and so 
\begin{align*}
  \absval{ \int_{\Gamma} e^{miz} Q(z) \dmeasure z }
  <&
  (2\eps/\pi)
  \int_{0}^{\half\pi}
  \rho e^{-2m\rho\theta/\pi} \dmeasure\theta
  \\
  =&
  (2\eps/\pi) \cdot (\pi/2m)
  \thebracket{ -e^{-2m\rho\theta/\pi} }_{0}^{\half\pi}
  \\
  <&
  \eps/m.
\end{align*}

%
% 116
%

Hence
$$
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\infty} \int_{\Gamma} e^{miz} Q(z) \dmeasure z = 0.
$$

This result is Jordan's lemma.

Now
$$
\int_{0}^{\rho}
\thebrace{
  e^{mix} Q(x) + e^{-mix} Q(-x)
}
\dmeasure x
=
2 \pi i \sum R'
-
\int_{\Gamma} e^{miz} Q(z) \dmeasure z,
$$
and, making $\rho\rightarrow\infty$, we see at once that
$$
\int_{0}^{\infty}
\thebrace{
  e^{mix} Q(x) + e^{-mix} Q(-x)
}
\dmeasure x
=
2 \pi i \sum R',
$$
which is the result corresponding to the result of \hardsubsubsectionref{6}{2}{2}{1}.

  (Take the contour of example TODO.)
\end{wandwexample}
\begin{wandwexample}
Shew that, if the real part of $z$ be positive,
$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} (e^{-t} - e^{-tz}) \frac{\dmeasure t}{t} = \log z.
$$
[We have
\begin{align*}
  \int_{0}^{\infty} (e^{-t} - e^{-tz}) \frac{\dmeasure t}{t} = \log z.
  =&
  \lim_{\delta\rightarrow 0, \rho\rightarrow\infty}
  \thebrace{
    \int_{\delta}^{\rho} \frac{e^{-t}}{t} \dmeasure t

    -
    \int_{\rho}^{\rho z} \frac{e^{-t}}{t} \dmeasure t,
  }
\end{align*}
since $t^{-1} e^{-t}$ is analytic inside the
quadrilateral whose corners are $\delta, \delta z, \rho z, \rho$.

Now $\int_{\rho}^{\rho z} t^{-1} e^{-t} \dmeasure t \rightarrow 0$
when $\Re(z) > 0$; and
$$
\int_{\delta}^{\delta z} t^{-1} e^{-t} \dmeasure t

-
\int_{\rho}^{\rho z} t^{-1} (1 - e^{-t}) \dmeasure t

since $t^{-1} (1 - e^{-t}) \rightarrow 1$ as $t \rightarrow 0$.]

\Subsection{6}{2}{3}{Principal values of integrals.}
%\begin{smallfont}
It was assumed in TODO that the function $Q(x)$ had no
poles on the real axis; if the function has a finite number of simple
poles on the real axis, we can obtain theorems corresponding to those
already obtained, except that the integrals are all principal values
(\hardsectionref{4}{5}) and $\sum R$ has to be replaced by
$\sum R + \half \sum R_{0}$, where $\sum R_{0}$ means the
sum of the residues at the poles on the real axis. To obtain this
result we see that, instead of the former contour, we have to take as
contour a circle of radius $\rho$ and the portions of the real axis joining
the points
$$
-\rho, \ a-\delta_{1};
\quad
a+\delta_{1}, \ b-\delta_{2};
\quad
b+\delta_{2}, \ c-\delta_{3},
\ \ldots
$$
and small semicircles above the real axis of radii
$\delta_{1},\delta_{2},\ldots$ with
centres $a, b, c, \ldots$ where $a, b, c, \ldots$ are the poles of
$Q(z)$ on the real axis; and then we have to make
$\delta_{1}, \delta_{2}, \ldots \rightarrow 0$;
call these semicircles $\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2},\ldots$.
Then instead of the equation
$$
\int_{-\rho}^{\rho} Q(z) \dmeasure z
+
\int_{\Gamma} Q(z) \dmeasure z
=
2 \pi i \sum R,
$$
we get
$$
P \int_{-\rho}^{\rho} Q(z) \dmeasure z
+
\sum_{n}
\lim_{\delta_{n} \rightarrow 0}
\int_{\gamma_{n}} Q(z) \dmeasure z
+
\int_{\Gamma} Q(z) \dmeasure z
=
2 \pi i \sum R.
$$

Let $a'$ be the residue of $Q(z)$ at $a$; then writing
$z = a + \delta_{1} e^{i\theta}$ on $\gamma_{1}$ we get
$$
\int_{\gamma_{1}} Q(z) \dmeasure z
=
\int_{\pi}^{0}
Q(a + \delta_{1} e^{i\theta})
\delta_{1} e^{i\theta} i \dmeasure \theta.
$$
But $Q(a + \delta_{1} e^{i\theta}) \rightarrow a'$ 
uniformly as $\delta_{1} \rightarrow 0$; and therefore
$
\lim_{\delta_{1} \rightarrow 0} \int_{\gamma_{1}} Q(z) \dmeasure z
=
- \pi i a'
$;
we thus get
$$
P \int_{-\rho}^{\rho} Q(z) \dmeasure z
+
\int_{\Gamma} Q(z) \dmeasure z
=
2 \pi i \sum R
+
\pi i \sum R_{0},
$$
and hence, using the arguments of \hardsubsectionref{6}{2}{2}, we get
$$
P \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} Q(x) \dmeasure x
=
2 \pi i (\sum R + \half \sum R_{0}).
$$

The reader will see at once that the theorems of TODO have
precisely similar generalisations.

The process employed above of inserting arcs of small circles so as to
diminish the area of the contour is called \emph{indenting} the contour.

\log (-z) = \log \absval{z} + \arg (-z),
$$
where
$$
-\pi \leq \arg (-z) \leq \pi; %TODO:is overlap correct?
$$
with these conventions the integrand is one-valued and analytic on and
within the contour save at the poles of $Q(z)$.

Hence, if $\sum r$ denote the sum of the residues of $(-z)^{a-1} Q(z)$
at all its poles,
$$
\int_{C} (-z)^{a-1} Q(z) \dmeasure z = 2 \pi i \sum r.
$$

On the small circle write $-z = \delta e^{i\theta}$, and the integral
along it becomes
$- \int_{\pi}^{-\pi} (-z)^{a} Q(z) i \dmeasure \theta$,
which tends to zero as $\delta \rightarrow 0$.

On the large semicircle write - z = pe', and the integral along it
becomes - I - sT Q (2) idO, which tends to zero as p- > x .

On one of the lines we write - z = xe"\ on the other - z = xe~' ' and
(-zy~ becomes a; - e±'"-i>'''.

Hence

Corollary. If Q(x) have a number of simple poles on the positive part
of the real axis, it may be shewn by indenting the contour that

P j a;"~ Q (x) dx - tt cosec (citt) S?' - tt cot ((/tt) 2r', .

where 1r' is the sum of the residues of z"'- Q (z) at these poles.

\Section{6}{3}{Cauchy's integral.}
 We shall next discuss a class of contour-integrals which are
sometimes found useful in analytical investigations.

Let Cbe a contour in the 2-plane, and let/(s) be a function analytic
inside and on C. Let (2) be another function which is analytic inside
and on G except at a finite luimber of poles; let the zeros of < z)
in the interior* of C be a,, 02, ..., and let their degrees of
multiplicity be rj, ro, ...; and let its poles in the interior of C
be 6j, ho, ..., and let their degrees of multiplicity be 5,, §2) •••

Then, by the fundamental theorem of residues, - - . I fiz) dz is equal
to the sum

 2ni J c' (f> z)

of the residues of--- ' at its poles inside C. <i> z)

Now- -- - can have singularities only at the poles and zeros of 0(s).
Near one

of the zeros, say otj, we have

0(2) = iI(2-ai)'-i-|-5(2-ai)'-. + i-f-.... Therefore < ' (2) = Ar z -
a- Yi -1 + 5 (r, + 1 ) (s - ai) -i + . . .,

and /(2)=/( i) + (2- i)/'( i) + ....

Therefore P - ' ] is analytic at a, .

Thus the residue of j -, at the point 2 =,, is rif ai). Similarly
the residue at 2 = 61 is - Si/(6j); for near 2 = 61, we have

( (2) = C(2-6,j- . + Z>(2-6,)-*, + l-l-...,

and f z)=f bi) + z-b,)f' b,) + ...,

so f!' + '- is analytic at i . 0(2) 2-61

Hence i J/ ' f clz = 2r,fia,) - 2s,f b,),

the summations being extended over all the zeros and poles of (f) (2).

\Subsection{6}{3}{1}{The number of roots of an equation contained within a contour.}
The result of the preceding paragraph can be at once applied to find
how many roots of an equation cj) z) = lie within a contour C.

For, on putting /(2) = 1 in the preceding result, we obtain the
resvilt that

z)

27rilc z)' '

is equal to the excess of the number of zeros over the number of poles
of (2) contained in

the interior of C, each pole and zero being reckoned according to its
degree of multiplicity.

* (f) ( ) must not have any zeros or poles on C.

Example 1, Shew that a polynomial < (2) of degree m has m roots.

Let ( (2) = ao2™ + ais'"~ + . .. +,, ( o=t=0)-

rpj gj ) \ > og'"~ + •••+ -1

( (2) ao2' + ...+,

Consequently, for large values of | 2 |,

Thus, if C be a circle of radius p whose centre is at the origin, we
have

27rt J c (p ) 27r \ / c 2 27ri / \ z / 2itI J c V J

But, as in § 6-22, j (\ \ dz O

as p- ao; and hence as (f) z) has no poles in the interior of C, the
total number of zeros of (f) (2) is

lim -- . I - ( 2 = TO.

Example 2. If at all points of a contour C the inequality

l fcS*|>l o + i2 + ... + ai-i~ * ~ + fc+i2' i + ... + a, 2'"j is
satisfied, then the contour contains /(• roots of the equation a, 2'"
+, \ ! 2' - 1 + . . . + ! 2 + o = 0. For write / (2) = a z''' + a \ 1
2"'- - 1 + . . . + ai2 + ao .

Then /(2) =,2 i -- + ...+a..,i2 -fa,-i2> -' + ...+ao\

= a,2' (l + tO, where | f/"! a < 1 on the contour, a being
independent* of 2. Therefore the number of roots of f z) contained in
C

27 jc/(2) 2injc\ s l+U dzj

But I - - 2T!-i; and, since | C/'|<1, we can expand (1 + U)~' in the
uniformly cou- vergent series

Therefore the number of roots contained in C is equal to i: Example 3.
Find how mauy I'oots of the equation

* I C/ 1 is a continuous function of z on C, and so attains its upper
bound (§ 3-62). Hence its upper bound a must be less than 1.

\Section{6}{4}{Connexion between the zeros of a function and the zeros of its
derivative.}

Macdonald* has shewn that if fiz) he a fvMction of z analytic
throughout the interior of a single closed contour C, defined hy the
equation \ f z) i = 3 where M is a constant, then the number of zeros
of f z) in this region exceeds the number of zeros of the derived
function f z) in the same region hy unity.

On C \ etf z) = 3fe'e; then at points on C

/ =*'"-|- '•" = ' "" 'S-(I) -

Hence, by § 6'31, the excess of the number of zeros oi f z) over the
number of zeros of/'(s) inside + C is

27 j c f z) ~ 27ri j cf (2) 27rt j c U ' / dz) ' •

Let s be the arc of C measured from a fixed point and let y he the

dB Now log, is purely real and its initial value is the same as its
final value; and

dz log =i\ j/; hence the excess of the number of zei'os oi f z) over
the number of zeros of

/' (s) is the change in y rj'iiT in describing the curve C; and it is
obvious J that if C is any ordinary curve, >// increases by 27r as the
point of contact of the tangent describes the curve C; this gives the
required result.

Example 1. Deduce from Macdonald's result the theorem that a
polynomial of degree n has n zeros.

Example 2. Deduce from Macdonald's result that if a function/ (2),
analytic for real values of z, has all its coefficients real, and all
its zeros real and different, then between two consecutive zeros oi f
z) there is one zero and one only of/' (2).
